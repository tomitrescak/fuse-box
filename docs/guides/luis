<h2>LUIS: Component development and testing framework</h2>
</center>

# TL; DR;

If you like [StoryBook](https://storybook.io) but miss the power and speed of FuseBox **Luis** is here for you. **Luis** brings:

* React component development
* Seamless snapshot-based testing
* Snapshot management
* Web component catalogue
* Integration with VS Code and Wallaby.js
  ... and much more!

# Introduction

LUIS (**L**ist of **U**ser **I**nterface**s**) is framework for collaborative building and testing React web components. It harnesses the power of [FuseBox](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box) for **fastest** bundling, hot reloads, and out-of-the-box Typescript support. Following are stats for application with 976 typescript sources and 56 imported packages:

* **StoryBook** — Start `36 seconds`, Hot Module Reload with sourcemaps `9 seconds`.
* **LUIS** — Start `400 ms`, Hot Module Reload with sourcemaps `750 ms`. Now that's what I call a significant difference.

Luis is using well known technologies ([Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), optionally [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com)) and methodologies (TDD, BDD, Snapshot testing), so there is almost nothing new to learn (apart from two new functions, **storyOf** and **itMountsAnd**).

If you want to learn more about Luis, go to the [project page](https://github.com/tomitrescak/luis) and start being productive!
